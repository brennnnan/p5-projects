#Sequencer
This is a drum sequencer inspired by the sounds of the 909. 

##How to use:
- Click on a dot to turn on that step. Each row represents one voice, and each column represents 1/16 note.
- The knobs on the left hand side control the volume of the corresponding voice.
- All steps can be turned off by pushing the reset button
